# computem
work in progress

These programs calculate high resolution conventional and scanning transmission electron microscope (CTEM, STEM) images of thin specimens from first principles using the multislice method for electrons in the energy range of approximately 60 keV to 1000 keV.  The fundamental theory and usage are described in "Advanced Computing in Electron Microscopy" (Springer 2020) and Acta Cryst. A72 (2016) p. 1 by Earl J. Kirkland.  Please refer to these for the theory of calculation and how to use these programs.

computem uses a GUI and the temsim group uses a command line interface.  The user is assumed to have some understanding of optics, Fourier transforms, electron microscopy and computer skills at the graduate or advanced undergraduate level.
